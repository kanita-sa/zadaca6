OOP - Common Data Structures 

Create the class Bookshelf. The bookshelf class holds Books (class) in a list of Books.
Book:
Attributes:
title - String
ISBN - long
author - String
Constructor:
3 parameters, setting the values of attributes
Method:
toString() - returning a String in the format title, author (ISBN)
Bookshelf:
1 Attribute being a list of Books
Constructor without parameters, creating an empty BookShelf
Methods:
containsBook(String title) - returning boolean depending if the shelf contains a Book with the 
provided title
containsBook(long ISBN) - returning boolean depending if the shelf contains a Book with the 
provided ISBN
printBookshelf() - prints all Books from the bookshelf
—————————————————————————————————————————
Create the class Robot. The Robot moves on a plane similar to a coordinate system.
It has 2 constructors:
Without parameters - the Robot starts at position (0,0)
With 2 parameters - initialises the Robot at position (x,y)
The Robot has couple of methods:
moveSouth() - moves the Robot to the south, meaning it will decrease the y.position by 1
moveNorth() - moves the Robot to the south, meaning it will increase the y.position by 1
moveEast() - moves the Robot to the south, meaning it will increase the x.position by 1
moveWest() - moves the Robot to the south, meaning it will decrease the x.position by 1
getPosition() - return current position
double getDistance() - returns the euclidean distance from the initial position
The distance is calculated as sqrt((x0 - x1)2 + (y0 - y1)2), where (x0, y0) is the initial position and 
(x1, y1) being the current position. The distance is a double.
getMoves() - return the number of moves the Robot performed
printLastPosition(int n) - prints the n last position starting from the last (backwards)
if n > number of moves, print all moves
Example of print:
(2,5)
(1,5)
(1,4
